# MinecraftPlugins
Plugins I made to mod Minecraft.

Most of these I made when I was in the freshman year of high school because I wanted to create minecraft mods for minecraft videos (I really thought I was the next Dream). I tried to make videos with these but I had a crappy laptop only at the time so I couldn't actually even record content, which was sad because I got all my friends into a video, tried to record it, and epically failed. Enough backstory though, I just wanted to upload these to GitHub as a portfolio of sorts of my failed adventures back when I was youthful and had the big dream of being just like Technoblade (this was before he got cancer, RIP to the legend.)
